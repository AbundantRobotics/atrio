# atrio
# Trio communication through telnet
The telnet seat is to be shared with Motion Perfect, so it needs to be closed for the scripts in this folder to work.

The trio script allows to send command to a trio and manage the programs in the controller.


# TODO
- Allow bidirectional interactive sync
- refactor workspace file to have a folder and prognames, not full path (makes things complex), but add the folder path in the worksapce file
- refactor 
- When upload MC_CONFIG.MCC reset the controller.
